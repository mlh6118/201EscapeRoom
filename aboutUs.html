        MARNI HAGER<br>
        Marni is a manufacturing engineer with 16 years of industry experience.  She is currently studying to become a software developer.  Having taken several different programming classes in college for fun, Marni found she liked dabbling in it.  At her current job, a need arose for things that were taking too long manually to be automated.  Marni spent the time to teach herself VBA for Excel and Python leading to a 4800% time savings for her team.  It was during the days of getting to work on code that Marni realized it was what she wants to do for a living.  Marni spends her free time solving all sorts of puzzles, doing escape rooms, and cuddling with her cats, Whiskey and Echo.
